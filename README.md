# Equivalent-Resistance-Calculator
This C program lets you calculate the resistance between any two points in a resistor network. It's menu-based and easy to use.  It can handle networks of any size, lets you create circuits by connecting nodes, has a color-coded terminal interface, and uses Nodal Analysis with Gaussian Elimination to get the resistance values.
